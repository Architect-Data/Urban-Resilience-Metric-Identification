# Urban-Resilience-Metric-Identification
This is a project I've worked with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory as a partner with Northeastern University. 
The project has been selected as top 10 projects to display in 100th year Northeastern University anniversity, presented to the president of Northeastern University.

Rockefeller foundation conducted city resilience research on selected 100 different cities worldwide. The foundation provided resilience strategy to overcome city's socioeconomic and different stresses the city encounters. This project looks into key resilience metric defining the universal metric that measure the cities using techniques such as Spacy, NLTK, TF-IDF, etc. 

Our definition of urban resilience is the capability of a city to survive, adapt and thrive in chronic stresses and acute shocks. The goal of this project is to leverage the NLP capabilities to automatically harvest, extract, categorize as defined by major worldwide cities.

This is a project I've worked with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory company based in Seattle.

The resulting interactive dashboard is attached; Resiliency Dashboard Tableau file also separately. The dashboard results are snipped and uploaded as a file.
